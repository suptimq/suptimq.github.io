    I love coming up with crazy and cool ideas, then bring them to life with sound engineering principles. I have
    graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering 
    from South China University of Technology. I am currently working on a Master of Engineering degree in
    Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell, focusing on computer science and engineering. I am actively looking for
    full time internship, and am available to start upon Summer 2020.
