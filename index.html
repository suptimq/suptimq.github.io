  <p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}" style="text-align: justify;">
    I love coming up with crazy and cool ideas, then bring them to life with sound engineering principles. I have
    graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering
    from South China University of Technology. I am currently working on a Master of Engineering degree in
    Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell, focusing on computer science and engineering. I am actively looking
    for
    full time internship, and am available to start upon Summer 2020.

    Professionally, I have worked as an intern twice during undergraduate, first at <a href="http://www.kuaipiyun.com/"
      target="_blank">KP Information Tech</a> as a Front-End Engineer then at <a href="https://www.meiyapico.com/"
      target="_blank">Meiya Pico</a> as an Algorithm Engineer focusing on Computer Vision.

    I am a crazy fan of outdoor activities, having more than 5000 kilometers road-trip experiences (cycling and
    driving). What I learned from
    such experiences is keeping optimistic and persistence.
    With my technical knowledge and
    outdoor experiences, I hope to make a positive impact on the world
    by leveraging the best from technology and daily life.
